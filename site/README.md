# reveal.js GitHub Pages Site

This site was rendered with Quarto and pushed from 
[umich-biostatistics/revealjs-course-site](github.com/umich-biostatistics/revealjs-course-site)
as a git subtree.

An alternative to create something similar would be to use a `.gitignore` file
that ignores all but your `site/` or `doc/` directory, whatever you use as
the output dir for your quarto site.

Or just share your whole working folder if it doesn't matter and can be public,
rendering your github page from the appropriate folder.
